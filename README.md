# ML-security

This repository contains code files for ECE-GY 9163 Machine Learning for Cybersecurity.

Steps to run our code:

* Our approach is RAM intensive because it generates 50 perturbations for every input image. We recommend using less than a 1500 clean images and 1500 poisoned images.
* Also, our approach takes 3 inputs, the badnet model, clean validation set, and poisoned set.
* Create a directory with the name 'CSAW-HackML-2020-master_new' in google drive 
* Upload the datasets and the models to google drive in appropriate directories as shown.

* Open the provided '.ipynb' notebook in Colab, mount your google drive and run the code.
